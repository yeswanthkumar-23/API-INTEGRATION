'PROJECT DESCRIPTION':

This weather web page is an interactive application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for any city and view real-time weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general conditions like rain or clear skies.

The design was implemented using Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor for web development. The layout is created with HTML, styled using CSS with a gradient background and responsive card, and made interactive through JavaScript. The application supports dynamic behavior like changing weather icons based on the current weather condition.

The core functionality is powered by the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides accurate and up-to-date weather data. The API is accessed through HTTP requests, and the data is returned in JSON format. A unique API key is used for authentication.

Key features include:

Live weather search by city

Dynamic icons and background based on weather

Error message for invalid city names

Enter key and Clear button functionality

Loading spinner while fetching data

Overall, this project showcases how basic web technologies can be used to build a real-time weather dashboard using public APIs.
